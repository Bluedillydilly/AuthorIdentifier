# AuthorIdentifies
An attempt at identifying different authors of text. Given a text conversation, idenitify the messages sent by each actor in the conversation.

## Motivation
I was have always been curious about idiolects, a specific person's unique way of speaking; a personal dialect, on the internet. Audio idiolects are quite pronounced can easily be used to identify friends in large gatherings or without even seeing them.

 Additionally, on anonymous forums text idiolect speech patterns could be used to de-anonymize individuals, weakening opsec on these forums. Theremore, I was also curious to see if users of accounts across several websites could be linked together.
